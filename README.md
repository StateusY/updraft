# Updraft

Updraft is a server-side datapack that works on Vanilla, Fabric, Quilt, Forge, and NeoForge loaders.

This datapack attempts to add an early-mid game (before elytra) method of flight/vertical transportation that encourages player infrastructure.

## Features

Updraft adds the titular updraft, a column of air sourced from an end crystal that has been transformed by using a Gust Core nearby. Also added is the Parachute Vest, a chestplate utility piece that applies slow falling when jumping from high heights (~5 blocks up). Given that using an Updraft may be perilous (fall damage!), the Parachute Vest is designed to be used with the Updraft to not only prevent death by fall damage, but also to allow for air travel.

The Gallery provides the crafting recipes for the Gust Core and Parachute Vest.

To give yourself the items with commands, run 
``/loot give @s loot updraft:items/gust_core`` for the Gust Core, and
``/loot give @s loot updraft:items/parachute_vest`` for the Parachute Vest.

## Install

To install this datapack, download the version for your game version, and place it in your world's datapack folder.

## The Future

I personally plan to add advancements sometime in the future, but the original goal of this project has been mostly finished.
